# Diabetes-Prediction

The goal of this notebook is to determine which model is most effective at predicting whether a female patient has diabetes, based on data from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. To do this, we will compare the performance of two supervised learning models (decision trees and random forests) and one unsupervised learning model (k-medoids algorithm) on the dataset.
